# Unstructured-Data-Analytics-Masters-Assignments
These are some Unstructured Data Analytics assignments that I carried out during my Mater's. Really fun stuff!

1. Project 1 (Task 2): Make comparisons between movies/feature films from two popular genres, namely the romance and horror genres.
2. Project 1 (Task 4): Word clouds are generated based on three songs with differing themes, namely “The Scientist” by Coldplay, “Better Than Revenge” by Taylor Swift and “Royals” by Lorde.
3. Project 2 (Task 1): Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling is applied on 35 news articles regarding natural disasters to get a rough idea of the categories of text data available. This will then provide a more comprehensive understanding of the prevailing themes surrounding natural disasters that are portrayed by the media.
4. Project 2 (Task 2): By utilising the data from Project 2 Task 1, this task aims to construct data clustering using three different clustering algorithms, namely k-means, hierarchical and HDBScan.
5. Project 2 (Task 3): Sentiment analysis of ice-cream product reviews.
