# Unstructured-Data-Analytics-Masters-Assignments
These are some Unstructured Data Analytics assignments that I carried out during my Mater's. Really fun stuff!

1. Project 1 (Task 2): Make comparisons between movies/feature films from two popular genres, namely the romance and horror genres.
2. Project 1 (Task 4): Word clouds are generated based on three songs with differing themes, namely “The Scientist” by Coldplay, “Better Than Revenge” by Taylor Swift and “Royals” by Lorde.
