"Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry"
You don't know how lovely you are
"I had to find you, tell you I need you"
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
"Oh, let's go back to the start"
"Running in circles, coming up tails"
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
"Oh, take me back to the start"
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
"Questions of science, science and progress"
Do not speak as loud as my heart
"But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me"
Oh and I rush to the start
"Running in circles, chasing our tails"
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
"Oh, it's such a shame for us to part"
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
"Ha, time for a little revenge"
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
"And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him"
"She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause"
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
"I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it"
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
"She's an actress, whoa"
She's better known for the things that she does
"On the mattress, whoa"
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
"She should keep in mind,"
She should keep in mind
"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha"
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
"And, she thinks I'm psycho"
"'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but"
"Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know"
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
"She's an actress, whoa"
She's better known for the things that she does
"On the mattress, whoa"
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
"She should keep in mind,"
She should keep in mind
"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha"
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
"You might have him, but haven't you heard"
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
"You might have him, but I'll always get the last word"
Whoa
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
"She's an actress, whoa"
She's better known for the things that she does
"On the mattress, whoa"
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
"She should keep in mind,"
She should keep in mind
"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha"
"And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,"
"'Cause I don't think you do, oh"
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
"I don't think you do, I don't think you do"
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
"In a torn up town, no postcode envy"
But every song's like
"Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom"
"Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room"
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
"Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece"
"Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash"
We don't care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
"And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)"
Let me live that fantasy
"My friends and I, we've cracked the code"
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
"That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money"
But every song's like
"Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom"
"Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room"
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
"Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece"
"Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash"
We don't care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
"And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)"
Let me live that fantasy
Oh
"Oh (oh, oh)"
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Oh
"Oh (oh, oh)"
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
"And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)"
Let me live that fantasy
